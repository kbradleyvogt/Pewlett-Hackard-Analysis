# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Objective 
The purpose of our project is to determe the number of retiring emplees by title and idntify which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. We will use the birth range of January, 1 1952 to December 31, 1955, as well as current employment status, department and title to better understand the organzational impact. As the organzation begins preparing for the "silver tsunami" this is just the beginning of the work needed to understand and mitigate the impact of this demographic shift.

## Results 

Reviewing the title table we can see a few things:

- The number of potential retirees is high!
- More then 60% of the retiring empolyees have a "Senior" title

Reviewing the mentorship eligibility:

- There are only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship progam. 
- With 90,000+ potential reritments, more work will need to be done to capture insitutional knowledge and train the future workforce. Perpahs expanding the eligible of the program outside of 1965 births 

## Summary

Seeing the 63 % of the workforce is either retirment or mentorship eligible there will most likely be many positions to fill over the next 5-10 years. There may not be enough people in the workforce to take care of the tasks or even come close to the amount of experience to fill these roles so quickly. To be successful in the future, companies will need to think beyond what has been successful and think about what future success looks like. This will relay on machine learning, automation and deeper data understanding to optimize resources that are avalible for the work of tomorrow.
